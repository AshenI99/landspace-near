# LandSpace-Dapp

## Description
LandSpace is a platform where users are able to sell lands and real estates through an auction and an instant price. This project is a simplified version of my solidity-101 submission. 

## Functionalities
Users are able to:
1. Upload a land/home they own onto the platform to be auctioned
2. Buy land/home on sale through bidding or buying with the instant price
3. Owners are able to end the auction
